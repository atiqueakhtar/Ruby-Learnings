# Ruby-Learnings
- greeting = 'Hello' (This tells Ruby to associate the greeting with the String object whose value is 'Hello'. In Ruby, greeting is said to reference (or point to) the String object).

- Pass by value, as youâ€™ll recall, means copying the original objects, so the original object cannot be mutated. Since immutable objects cannot be changed, they act like Ruby passes them around by value.

```ruby
def increment(a)
  a = a + 1
end
b = 3
puts increment(b)    # prints 4
puts b               # prints 3
```

- Rubyists typically want to name those getter and setter methods using the same name as the instance variable they are exposing and setting:
```ruby
class GoodDog
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def name                  # This was renamed from "get_name"
    @name
  end

  def name=(n)              # This was renamed from "set_name="
    @name = n
  end

  def speak
    "#{@name} says arf!"
  end
end

sparky = GoodDog.new("Sparky")
puts sparky.speak
puts sparky.name            # => "Sparky"
sparky.name = "Spartacus"
puts sparky.name            # => "Spartacus"
```

- You'll notice that writing those getter and setter methods took up a lot of room in our program for such a simple feature. And if we had other states we wanted to track, like height or weight, the class would be even longer. Because these methods are so commonplace, Ruby has a built-in way to automatically create these getter and setter methods for us, using the attr_accessor method.

```ruby
class GoodDog
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def speak
    "#{@name} says arf!"
  end
end

sparky = GoodDog.new("Sparky")
puts sparky.speak
puts sparky.name            # => "Sparky"
sparky.name = "Spartacus"
puts sparky.name            # => "Spartacus"
```
