# Ruby-Learnings
- greeting = 'Hello' (This tells Ruby to associate the greeting with the String object whose value is 'Hello'. In Ruby, greeting is said to reference (or point to) the String object).

- Pass by value, as youâ€™ll recall, means copying the original objects, so the original object cannot be mutated. Since immutable objects cannot be changed, they act like Ruby passes them around by value.

def increment(a)
  a = a + 1
end
b = 3
puts increment(b)    # prints 4
puts b               # prints 3
